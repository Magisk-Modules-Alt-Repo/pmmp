> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The binary included in this Magisk module is now only prebuilt from [TukangM/php8-aarch64-builds/releases](https://github.com/TukangM/php8-aarch64-builds/releases). As of December 2024, PocketMine-MP at [PHP-Binary releases](https://github.com/pmmp/PHP-Binaries/releases) has added CI automation builds for linux-arm64. Therefore, the `update-pmmp` function will remain updated to the latest version in the next update from [PHP-Binary](https://github.com/pmmp/PHP-Binaries/releases).

## Installation

There are several ways to install the PocketMine-MP4Android Magisk module:

### Method 1: Using Magisk Manager or KernelSU

1.  Download the latest release of the module from the [Releases page](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Alt-Repo/pmmp/releases).
2.  Open your Magisk Manager or KernelSU application.
3.  Navigate to the "Modules" section.
4.  Tap the "+" or "Install" button and select the downloaded ZIP file.
5.  Reboot your Android device to activate the module.

### Method 2: Using a Module Manager App

You can also use a third-off-party module manager that supports the Magisk-Modules-Alt-Repo, such as:

*   [MMRL](https://github.com/DerGoogler/MMRL)
*   [Androidacy Module Manager](https://github.com/Androidacy/MagiskModuleManager)

Simply enable the Magisk-Modules-Alt-Repo in the settings of your chosen module manager and install the "PocketMine-MP4Android" module directly from there.


## Usage

1. Open a terminal emulator on Android (e.g., Termux) or use ADB shell.
2. Execute these commands:
   - Superuser access:
     ```bash
     su
     start-pmmp
     ```
   - For Termux:
     ```bash
     su
     start-pmmp
     ```
3. If `start-pmmp` doesnâ€™t work, manually run the start script:
   ```bash
   cd /data/local/pmmp
   sh start.sh
   ```

## Workaround for Port Forwarding

You can use [Magisk Tailscaled](https://github.com/anasfanani/Magisk-Tailscaled), Tailscale from Play Store, or Playit.gg (development in progress). Currently, **playit-linux-aarch64** has issues on Android, requiring changes or running on **proot**. For now, tunneling with Playit.gg on Android is not possible. Running it in Termux with a **proot Ubuntu core image** is an alternative.

## Uninstallation

The `pmmp` folder will not be removed upon uninstalling the module. This ensures that your world data, plugins, and server settings remain intact.

## Updating

To update the PHP8 binaries and PocketMine-MP, use the `update-pmmp` script. This script allows you to selectively update components as needed. Here are the available options:

```bash
update-pmmp [options]
```

### Options:
- `--all, -a`: Update both PocketMine-MP.phar and PHP binaries.
- `--phar-only, -p`: Update only the PocketMine-MP.phar file.
- `--php-only, -b`: Update only the PHP binaries.
- `--help`: Show this help message.

The PHP8 precompiled binary is sourced from [TukangM/php8-aarch64-builds](https://github.com/TukangM/php8-aarch64-builds).

Make sure to check the terminal output for any errors during the update process.

## Roadmap

- [x] Function update binary php8 and server phar
- [ ] rewrite update-pmmp (update.sh)
- [ ] amd64 php8 binary support
- [ ] WebUI functionality
